#This are the steps to follow when extending a volume group disk.

Step 1.
Power off your VM and add a new virtual disk from the Vm settings

Steop 2.
Run ths command just to verify that the new disk is available
ls -l /dev/sd*

Step 3.
Now, use the fdisk utility to partition the disk
fdisk /dev/sdb
hit (n) for new
hit (p) for primary partition
and partition number 1 and continue with default installations by hitting the enter button

Command (m for help): hit (t) and enter (8e) and hit (w) to write table to disk.
Run this command again fdisk /dev/sdb now you will see that a new partition has be added called (sdb1)

And your are done with the first part.

Step 4. PVCREAT
Now run this command: 
pvcreate /dev/sdb1
successfully created message will be displayed
run pvdisply  to display the new physical volume disk
do: vgdisplay    to see the volume group that are present

Step 5. Add the new physical you just created
vgextend -t -v centos /dev/sdb1     NB: the (-t) is to test command. A successful message will be displayed
vgextend -v centos /dev/sdb1  This is for real.
Run vgdisplay again to take a look

write down the : (Free  PE / Size)   this will the total number of space that you can add. PE stands for: PHYSICAL EXTENT
Do lvdisplay 

Step 6. Extend the logical volume
Test Run:  lvextend -l +the number of the PE size -r -t -v /dev/centos/root  NB: test mode

For real: lvextend -l +767 -r -v /dev/centos/root

Run: df -h   you now see that the root system disk has been extented.

Congrats!!!!!!
